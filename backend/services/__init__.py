# This file makes the 'services' directory a Python package.

# You can import services from here if you structure them accordingly.
# For example, if you have a DatabaseService class in database.py:
# from .database import DatabaseService
# from .message_bus import MessageBusService
# from .config import settings

# This makes them available like:
# from backend.services import DatabaseService, MessageBusService, settings
# (assuming backend is in PYTHONPATH or running from project root)

# For now, it can remain empty.
