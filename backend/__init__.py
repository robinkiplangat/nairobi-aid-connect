# This file makes the 'backend' directory a Python package.
# It can be empty.

# You could put package-level initializations here if needed,
# for example, setting up logging for the entire backend package.

# Example (optional):
# import logging
# logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
# logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
# logger.info("Backend package initialized.")
