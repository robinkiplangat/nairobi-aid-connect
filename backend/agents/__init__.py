# This file makes the 'agents' directory a Python package.

# You can import agent classes from here if desired.
# For example:
# from .intake_agent import IntakeAgent
# from .verification_agent import VerificationAgent
# ... and so on.

# This allows for imports like:
# from backend.agents import IntakeAgent
# (if backend is in PYTHONPATH or running from project root)

# For now, it can remain empty.
